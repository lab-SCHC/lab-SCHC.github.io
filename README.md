## About

### SCHC

[SCHC](https://www.actility.com/schc/) (pronounce "chic") is the acronym for
Static Context Header Compression, a standard compression and fragmentation
mechanism defined by the IPv6 over LPWAN working group at the
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/).

### Lab.SCHC

[Lab.SCHC](https://lab-schc.fr/) is the research and development laboratory
dedicated to advancing the SCHC mechanism for the Internet of Things (IoT), as a
collaborative initiative between [Actility](https://www.actility.com/) and [IMT
Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr).

A key objective is to promote the wide adoption of SCHC by offering an
**industrial-quality open-source embedded software stack**.

### Lab.SCHC FullSDK

The lab.SCHC FullSDK turns any IoT device into a native IP one that can be
addressed from the client application.

It enriches the most constrained LPWAN devices with the ability to use the
TCP/IP stack, improves functionality and energy performance.
end-to-end security support.
